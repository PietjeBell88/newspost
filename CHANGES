1.20 - changes by William McBrine
 - .newspost values were sometimes not zero-terminated on rereading,
resulting in garbled settings; fixed
 - messages that had a '.' in the first position on a line could be
posted incorrectly; fixed
 - changed status display to show "Posting n of n" instead of hash
marks
 - lines in the body of the article now end correctly in CRLF,
instead of just LF
 - temporary files are no longer created, except in the case of SFVs
generated by newspost
 - CRLF vs. LF is now handled correctly in reading and writing files
(and should now work under Windows as well as Unix)
 - "Organization" line is now optional; "Subject" parameter is 
optionally optional (see source)
 - corrected format of "User-Agent" line

 - much internal reorganization; faster, smaller, and probably easier
to compile
